# RiPLE-HC-ExperimentalData
-------------------------------------------------
This repository aggregates the data gathered during the evaluation of the **Ri**SE **P**roduct **L**ine **E**ngineering by **H**ybrid **C**omposition (RiPLE-HC) approach to build Javascript based product lines. 

In the following, we enumerate the content available and contact information.

#### Case Studies

These prjectes (which you can find in the folder 'case-studies')  are Software Product Lines (SPL) versions of different open-source projects. We used RiPLE-HC to perform the refactoring. All of them were conducted for experimental purposes, in case of interest in any of them, please refer to the original one.

:: Video.js-SPL derived from [Video.js](http://videojs.com).

:: Algorithms.js-SPL derived from [Algorithms.js](https://github.com/felipernb/algorithms.js).

:: FloraJS-SPL derived from [FloraJS](http://github.com/foldi/FloraJS).

:: Jasmine-SPL derived from [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io).

:: TimelineJS-SPL derived from [Timeline](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS)

:: Brackets-SPL derived from [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).


#### Controlled Experiment Data

The data from the controlled experiment with students you can find in the folder 'controlled-experiment'. The folder  holds the data used in a controlled experiment on the effectiveness of the RiPLE-HC approach. It contains:

- Experiment raw data.pdf
- Trainning session.pdf
- oracles
- tasks
