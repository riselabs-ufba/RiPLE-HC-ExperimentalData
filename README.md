Welcome to Brackets-SPL! 
-------------------

This is an early version of Brackets-SPL, an initiative to turn brackets editor into an Software Product Line. Here we used  [FeatureJS](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2556624.2556637), a [FeatureIDE](http://wwwiti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/iti_db/research/featureide/) composer, which implements a hybrid approach that combines compositional and annotative development aproaches.

**Brackets-SPL** is still a code editor for HTML, CSS and JavaScript that's *built* in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But the *FeatureJS* approach supports the switching off of some features of the original [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).
